  * To save the config file or scan the QR code, on either the phone or computer, you need the Wireguard app because the VPN uses the Wireguard protocol.

## Usage

#### On Phone

* Demo in the YouTube video.

* Install the Wireguard app on your phone.

* Either download the config file or scan the QR code in the Wireguard app.

* Enable it in Wireguard and Settings and you're done!

#### On Mac

* It's much easier to use the Wireguard Desktop app (as shown in the demo video), but you can follow these steps instead:

* Start WireGuard manually:
  ```sh
  wg-quick up wg-client
  ```

* Check status:
  ```sh
  sudo wg
  ```

* To stop it:
  ```sh
  wg-quick down wg-client
  ```
