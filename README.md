#### On Phone

Install the Wireguard app on your phone.

Scan the QR code in the Wireguard app.

Enable it in settings and you're done!

#### On Mac

It's much better to just use the Wireguard Desktop app (as shown in the demo videos), but you can follow these steps instead:

Start WireGuard manually:
wg-quick up wg-client

Check status:
sudo wg

To stop it:
wg-quick down wg-client

---

#### On the Server (EC2)

Restart the WireGuard service:
sudo systemctl restart wg-quick@wg0

Enable it to start on boot:
sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0

Check if it's running:
sudo systemctl status wg-quick@wg0

To see connected clients:
sudo wg show

To disable WireGuard (prevent auto-start):
sudo systemctl disable wg-quick@wg0
